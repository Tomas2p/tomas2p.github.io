## Summary

It's a web-based reimplementation of the [terminal version made in C++](/proyects/inovel_game/) with the aim of making it easier for the user by eliminating the need for terminals.

`Current Status: Testing` - stories are still not available as I haven't figured out how to implement them yet due to time constraints. At the moment, I have two ideas: the first one is to create something similar to the C++ version but using YAML or JSON, and the second involves creating stories in a PowerPoint and integrating it with the web.
